Hi! I'm Gavin, a junior Computer Science student currently attending UNC Charlotte.
On this site I will be displaying some of my personal projects.
My projects will mainly be pertaining to data science or analytics, as that is what my computer science concentration is in.

I am currently looking for internships, and full time work beginning May 2022.
